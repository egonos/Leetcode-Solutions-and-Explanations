# Leetcode Solutions and Explanations

## The Purpose of This Respiratory

Data science skills coincide with sofware skills a bit but not a lot. Currently I'm trying to enhance my coding abilities, therefore I'm solving the questions found in HackerRank and LeetCode. I decided to store my solutions in here so that I can see my progress and potentially help someone. Please note that the codes I provided does not have to be the most efficient ones. If it's working and the code belongs to "me", then I'll put in here. If I get stuck in a problem and can't solve it no matter what I do, I'll get a help from ChatGPT but even if I do it I'll rewrite the codes on my own. Besides that I'll try to provide explanations to test my capabilities even further. That's the best way to stay as honest as possible I guess. I hope you find the contents of this repository helpful and enjoyable.
