/*
Explanation
First, we obtained the combined table by matching country code from city with code from country.
Second, we pick African city names from the combined table.
FÄ°nally we filter the result by adding {where country.continent = 'Africa'}.

Note: To round up to nearest integer floor() should be used not round().

select country.continent, floor(avg(city.population)) from city inner join country on city.countrycode = country.code group by country.continent;
